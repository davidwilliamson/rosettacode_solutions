"""Sleep Sort

In general, sleep sort works by starting a separate task for each item to be
sorted, where each task sleeps for an interval corresponding to the item's sort
key, then emits the item. Items are then collected sequentially in time.

Task: Write a program that implements sleep sort. Have it accept non-negative
integers on the command line and print the integers in sorted order. If this
is not idomatic in your language or environment, input and output may be done
differently.
